An Event Emitter is a design pattern used in programming where objects (emitters) can send events that other parts of the program (listeners) can listen to and respond to.

ğŸ‘‰ It follows the Observer Pattern, where:

Emitters produce events.

Listeners subscribe to events and execute callbacks when events occur.

How Event Emitters Work
Register a listener for a specific event (on or addListener).

Emit an event (emit) with optional data.

Listener function executes when the event is emitted.
